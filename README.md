# LuxPersona

This Lux Persona prototype is a unique way to remember a loved one by creating holographic diary entries that reflect their personal experiences and characteristics.

The prototype also includes basic personal information about the loved one, such as their name, age, and occupation, to help create a more authentic and personal experience. By creating these holographic diary entries, users can relive memories and connect with their loved one in a way that feels tangible and real.

This project was built on Joost van Schaik's project.
